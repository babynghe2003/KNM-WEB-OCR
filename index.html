  <h1>1. OCR TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p>    Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technique used to convert images text into text that can be edited in a computer. The input of this process is an image file and the output will be a text file containing the content of the words and symbols contained in that image.
  </p>

  <p>    Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a technology that enables you to convert different types of documents, 
    such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital camera into editable and searchable data.

    Imagine you’ve got a paper document - for example, magazine article, brochure,
    or PDF contract your partner sent to you by email. Obviously, a scanner is not
      enough to make this information available for editing, say in Microsoft Word. All a 
      scanner can do is create an image or a snapshot of the document that is nothing more than a 
      collection of black and white or color dots, known as a raster image. In order to extract and repurpose 
      data from scanned documents, camera images or image-only PDFs, you need an OCR software that would single out 
      letters on the image, put them into words and then, words into sentences, thus enabling you to access and edit the 
      content of the original document.</p>

  <h1>2. ADVANTAGES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF OCR TECHNOLOGY</h1>
  <p>    With OCR, the recognized document looks just like the original. Advanced, 
    powerful OCR software allows you to save a lot of time and effort when creating, processing and repurposing 
    various documents. With OCR, you can scan paper documents for further editing and sharing
      with your colleagues and partners. You can extract quotes from books and magazines and use them 
      for creating your course studies and papers without the need of retyping.</p>

    <p>   With a digital camera and 
      OCR, you can capture text outdoors from banners, posters and timetables and then use the 
      captured information for your purposes. In the same way, you can capture information from paper 
      documents and books. For example, if there is not a scanner close at hand or you cannot use it. 
      In addition, you can use OCR software for creating searchable PDF archives.

    The entire process of data conversion from original paper document, image or PDF takes les
    s than a minute, and the final recognized document looks just like the original!</p>

  <h1>3. APPLICATIONS AND SOME POPULAR SOFTWARE</h1>
  <p>   The most well-known use case for optical character recognition (OCR) is converting printed paper documents into machine-readable text documents. Once a scanned paper document goes through OCR processing, the text of the document can be edited with a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
  </p>

    <p>   
    OCR is often used as a hidden technology, powering many well-known systems and services in our daily life. Important — but less-known — use cases for OCR technology include data-entry automation, assisting blind and visually impaired persons and indexing documents for search engines, such as passports, license plates, invoices, bank statements, business cards and automatic number plate recognition.

    </p>
    <p>
    OCR enables the optimization of big-data modeling by converting paper and scanned image documents into machine-readable, searchable pdf files. Processing and retrieving valuable information cannot be automated without first applying OCR in documents where text layers are not already present.
